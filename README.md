### Better Philippine Names (Hearts of Iron IV Mod)

#### About

It's a simple mod written for replacing entity names (ex. countries, units, flags, ships, etc.) for the Philippine Republic in the game, Hearts of Iron IV.

#### Why?

The names "Ganap Philippines" and "Huk Community of the Philippines" just suck, and those names are unheard and not existing in Philippine history.

In addition, the generic infantry division name for the Philippines, "1st Philippines Division" also suck (really Paradox Interactive?).

HOI4 is one of the most amazing strategy games out there but Filipino names just suck in the game, though I can understand it since the Philippines is just a minor nation in the game and in real-life, especially in WW2.

#### Installation notes
- Download the contents of this repository and place it on your `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod`. If the mod folder is not existing, then you can create it manually.
- Then, install the mod using the launcher or you can also install it manually by inserting the mod's name on `dlc.json` file.

#### Guarantees and limitations

This mod is meant to **replace only entity names. I did not override the vanilla features/mechanics for the game.** For example, the Phillipines will still be a democratic puppet of the US in the 1936 and 1939 starts of the game. I also did not changed any of the ideas, techs and equipment count of the Philippines.

It's because for me, the game vanilla mechanics are already enjoyable and enough. It's just that the names for the Philippine entities in the game suck.

Based from my manual testing, other nations can still be played normally while the mod is active.

I also created the mod in a way that it won't break any future DLC releases for HOI4.

#### Features

##### Country name changes
- Democratic Philippines will retain it's name, `Philippines`.
- Neutral/Monarchy Philippines will have a new name, `Haring Bayang Katagalugan` and will have a flag based on the Katipunan Magdalo Flag.
- Fascist Phillipines will be called `Pilipinas`. It will have the same flag as the democratic Philippines.
- Communist Philippines will be called `Bayan`. For it's flag, I chose the old neutral/monarchy Philippines flag.

Notes:

I chose the new names of the Philippines according to my own interpretation of Philippine History before and during World War II.

Regarding the Fascist Philippines' name, the Second Philippine Republic headed by former President Jose P. Laurel in real life didn't change the country's name. It's actual official name is `Republika ng Pilipinas` but you can notice that it has no official English translation, only Japanese and Spanish ones, since it's a puppet republic by the Japanese in WW2 [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Philippine_Republic).

For the communist Philippines, it's somewhat problematic because the "Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas" was just an underground movement in the 1930s and has no presence in Commonwealth-era Philippine politics. I just chose `Bayan` as it's name because I think they would choose it to be the Philippine's name if they would be able to have a chance to rule the archipelago.

For the `Haring Bayang Katagalugan` or (Sovereign Tagalog Nation), it's the one chosen by Andres Bonifacio to be the name of the new Independent Philippines.

Additional notes, **we can't use** the name `Maharlika` and the CPP-NPA-NDF flag (for the communist Philippines) because those concepts just became available after WW2.

##### Division name changes

- The default name for the Philippine infantry divisions will now be `%ordinalNumber% Infantry Division`. It's `%ordinalNumber% Philippines Division` on vanilla. For example, the first infantry division will be called **1st "Tabak" Infantry Division**.

- The default name for the Philippine armored divisions will now be `%ordinalNumber% Armored Division`. It's `%ordinalNumber% Philippines Tank Group` on vanilla. For example, the first armored division will be called **1st "Pambato" Armored Division**.

- The default name for the Philippine marine units will now be `%ordinalNumber% Marine Regiment`. It's `%ordinalNumber% Philippines Marine Div.` on vanilla. For example, the first marine unit will be called **1st Marine Regiment**.

- The default name for the Philippine mountain infantry units will now be `%ordinalNumber% Scout Ranger Regiment`. It's `%ordinalNumber% Philippines Mountain Div.` on vanilla. For example, the first mountain infantry division will be called **1st Scout Ranger Regiment**.

- The default name for the Philippine garrison infantry divisions will now be `%ordinalNumber% Infantry (Res.) Division`. It's `%ordinalNumber% Philippines Div.` on vanilla. For example, the first garrison infantry unit will be called **1st Infantry (Res.) Division**.

##### Ship name changes

- Surface ship names will now default to `RPS - Barkong Pandigma %romanNumeral%`. For example, it will be like **RPS - Barkong Pandigma I**. This rule will apply to all surface ships that will be created by the Phillipines (destroyers, cruisers to aircraft carriers and battleships).

- Submarine names will now default to `RPS - Submarino %romanNumeral%`. For example, it will be like **RPS - Submarino I**.

##### Bonus feature - Benigno Ramos

Benigno P. Ramos will now be the **default leader of the Fascist Philippines**. In real-life, he is the founder of the Sakdalistas and the Makapili [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benigno_Ramos). I also chose a generic portrait for him. He is a nationalist but somewhat controversial figure in Philippine History because he is a Japanese collaborationist.

#### Issues / Future notes

Please feel free to reports issues about bugs and feature requests that might be related to name changes only. I'm planning to create a separate mod/project in the future. The concept of the mod that I might create is `What if the 2021 Philippines has been transported back in time, in 1936 pre-WW2 era?`.
